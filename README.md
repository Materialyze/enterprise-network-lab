# Materialyze's Virtual Enterprise Network Simulation Lab

This project simulates a small enterprise network environment utilizing EVE-NG. This lab includes VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, static and dynamic routing, NAT, DHCP, and access control lists (ACLs). It is designed to demonstrate core networking concepts aligned with CompTIA Network+ and Cisco CCNA certification objectives.

## Project Goals

- [ ] Create a scalable network topology simulating a real-world enterprise environment
- [ ] Configure VLANs and inter-VLAN routing to segment departments
- [ ] Implement DHCP and NAT for IP management and internet access
- [ ] Apply ACLs to control network traffic
- [ ] Practice troubleshooting in a controlled lab environment
- [ ] Simulate outside breaches and how to quickly isolate affected systems, identify breaches, and minimize damage
